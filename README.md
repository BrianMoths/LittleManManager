Game Description
-----------

Welcome to little man manager! You have just gotten a new job after months of searching. The company hired you because they are in a pickle. They recently hired a top-notch candidate, the little man, but noticed one problem too late: the candidate does not speak your language. In fact he speaks a very strange language using numbers. Everyone has jobs they want the little man to do, but no one knows how to tell him to do it.

This is where you come in. Your job will be to take descriptions of jobs from your boss and translate these commands into the little man language.

Purpose of this project
------
This is supposed to be a simple program which gives a simple model of how a cpu works. This game is inspired by the [little man computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer). The game is supposed to be a implementation of an architecture similar to the little man architecture in an office setting. The player is given specifications what the little man must do (a program), and the player must produce a sequence of instructions that get the little man to do that action. The game is supposed to be fun, but also somewhat educational.
