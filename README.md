Game Description
-----------

Welcome to little man manager! You have just gotten a new job after months of searching. The company hired you because they are in a pickle. They recently hired a top-notch candidate, the little man, but noticed one problem too late: the candidate does not speak your language. In fact he speaks a very strange language using numbers. Everyone has jobs they want the little man to do, but no one knows how to tell him to do it.

This is where you come in. Your job will be to take descriptions of jobs from your boss and translate these commands into the little man language.

How to get started
----
Navigate to [the release page](https://github.com/BrianMoths/LittleManManager/releases/) and click the download link for the latest version of "LittleManManager.jar". Take note of where the files downloads to. You can check your java version by running the command `java -version`. To play the game you will need java 7 or later. [Here are instructions on how to install java](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml). Once you have installed java, run the command `java -jar LittleManManager.jar` in the same directory as `LittleManManager.jar`.

Once the game is started, you will be able to use the in game help to learn how to actually play the game.

Purpose of this project
------
This is supposed to be a simple program which gives a simple model of how a cpu works. This game is inspired by the [little man computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer). The game is supposed to be a implementation of an architecture similar to the little man architecture in an office setting. The player is given specifications what the little man must do (a program), and the player must produce a sequence of instructions that get the little man to do that action. The game is supposed to be fun, but also somewhat educational.

Status/future of project
-----
I have been working on this project on and off for about a year. It has now reached the point where it ready to be seen by other people, so I have uploaded it to github. If there is a positive response, and people like the game, I will continue working on it. If not then I won't invest any more time in it. I have never managed an open source project or made a game before, so this will be a learning experience for me. I intend to open source the project, but I do not know what license to choose at this point. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please contact me.
