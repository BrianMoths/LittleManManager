This is supposed to be a simple program which gives a simple model of how a cpu 
works. Many important features of a cpu will not be included in this minimal 
model. Features not included in this version could be included in a future more 
sophisticated version.

scope first iteration:
  what is covered: 
    basic instruction cycle: fetch decode to operation...
    instruction pointer
    von neumann achitecture
    basic instructions
    control structures involving jmp
    
    
  what is not covered:
    binary
    flag register
    multiple registers
    different word sizes: memory address resolution, instruction sizes, register size
    cache
    pipeline
    segmentation
    indexed addressing
    string instructions
    syscalls
